    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p> ... and the screams of the campers were silenced by the thunderous roars of the storm.</p>
    <p>Lightning dashed across the sky two and fro, illuminating the dark red splotches allong the campsite</p>
    <p> With a massive THOOM that could be heard for miles, the lightning struck down, incinerating trees and lighting the forest of trees ablaze.</p>
    <p>And in synch with the falling tree, the last camper fell lifelessly onto the cold, wet ground.</p>
